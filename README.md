### The libraries used
All the libraries are standard for Anaconda distribution, unless you have an older version of Anaconda in which case you might need to install seaborn separately. We use Python 3.6. 

### The motivation for the project

For someone considering switching careers to programming or just starting in the field, it might be interesting to get an idea of how it would influence their life and how it would fit their personality. I would like to investigate the following three questions:

* What are typical lifestyles among the developers?

* How supportive or tight is the community?

* What are the job priorities that make programmers happy?


### The files in the repository 

The repository contains:

* ds_blog.ipynb: the notebook with analysis for the blog post

### A summary of the results of the analysis

We found that typically programmers are leading reasonably healthy, balanced lives, are a part of a tight supportive community and care a lot about their work environment, collaborative spirit and impact of their work.
